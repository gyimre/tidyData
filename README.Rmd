## UCI HAR Dataset

The run_analysis.R code will pre-process the raw UCI HAR Datasets.

Every cases labeled according to the sample subset ("set"=test/train), the subject (unique identifier of the participants) and the activity (like walking, standing...).

Subsets are merged. Activities are labeled and columns are reordered. From various metrics only the mean and standard deviation statistics are selected.

Finally a tidy set created (DTtidy): averages of metrics by person (subject variable) and activity.

In the CodeBook.hmtl you can find a detailed description of every variable.
